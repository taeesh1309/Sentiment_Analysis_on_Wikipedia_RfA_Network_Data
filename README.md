The Wikipedia link graphs (SNAP) dataset is a significant collec-
tion of Wikipedia articles and their linkages. The dataset has been
used for a variety of tasks, including information retrieval, natural
language processing, and social network analysis. In this study, we
analyze a portion of the Wikipedia RfA network data, Sentiment
analysis on the data was done using sophisticated natural language
processing techniques. The results showed that the RfA comments
were categorized as positive, negative, or neutral, offering informa-
tion about the network dynamics. In addition, These observations
provide insightful data on the components of successful adminship
requests inside the RfA network.
